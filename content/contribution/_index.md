Small patches and bug reports can be submitted a issue tracker in Github. Forking on Github is another good way. You can send a pull request.

If you would like to contribute, here are some notes and guidlines.

* All development happens on the **develop** branch, so it is always the most up-to-date
* The **master** branch only contains tagged releases
* If you are going to be submitting a pull request, please submit your pull request to the **develop** branch
* See about [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
